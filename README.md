# WangwangPaw
Welcome to the digital photo album of our adorable orange tabby cat, WangWang. She was adopted from the Central Campus of the University of Science and Technology of China and officially became a member of our family on October 23, 2024. At that time, she was less than two months old, full of energy, curiosity, and very affectionate.
